Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of ride booking data from a ride-hailing platform using SQL and Power BI to understand booking demand, revenue trends, cancellation behavior, vehicle performance, and customer ratings. The objective of this project was to transform raw booking data into meaningful business insights that can help improve operational efficiency, driver allocation, and revenue optimization.

Tools and Technologies

SQL was used for data cleaning, transformation, and analytical querying
Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard and visualize key metrics
CSV dataset was used as the data source
Data analysis and visualization techniques were applied

Analysis Workflow

The dataset was first cleaned and structured using SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency. Analytical SQL queries were written to identify booking trends, revenue contribution, cancellation patterns, and vehicle performance. The processed data was then used to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a clear visualization of business performance and operational metrics.
