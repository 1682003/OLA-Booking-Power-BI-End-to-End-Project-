OLA Ride Booking Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project analyzes ride booking data from a ride hailing platform similar to Ola. The main goal of this project is to understand booking demand, revenue patterns, vehicle performance, and cancellation behavior. The analysis helps identify important trends that can support business decision making and improve operational efficiency.

This project demonstrates real world data analysis skills using SQL and Power BI, including data cleaning, querying, dashboard creation, and insight generation.
